        Ahh the ordinary City of Humans, Dilsen-Stokkem. <br>
        The place where The Child grew up, though it is plagued by humans, <br>
        It still has a lot of forest and nature. A rare sight these days. <br>
        For those who have seen "Beau Sejour" might remember that it is a real hotel and tavern<br>
        In a real Place called Lanklaar, part of Dilsen-Stokkem. <br>
        Mostly I only remember the bad Limburgisch Accent...
        <br> <br>
        Another interesting place is called "De Oude Toren", It used to be a church.<br>
        It was built in the year 1250 and since then it had survived fires and wars.<br>
        Untill a new one was built in 1912, where they demolished the old church, <br>
        Except for it's tower.<br>
        <br>
