The Child was not interested in other humans but drawn to fantasy! <br>
It's passion lays between playing games, drawing and escaping the daily life with cartoons. <br>
Whilst she was playing a game of League Of Legends she met some people she could call her friends. <br>
Later she found interest in one particular fellow named Bradley. <br>

Moving on ... <br>whilst gaming was still in her mind, her passion for drawing grew.<br>

Still need a little more practice if you want my opinion.
